# BED (Back-End Development) ST0503

This was a module I took in Year 1 Semester 2 (Y1S2).

For this module, we had one project that we continually worked on throughout the semester.  
However, the `CA1` and `CA2` folders contain the project when I submitted it for their respective assignment.  
**Note:** As for the project, I added my own features on top of assignment, as such it the project has its own repo [here](https://github.com/chuanhao01/Full_Stack_Web_App).  
But the project files I submitted at the time for assignment will be in the folder.
