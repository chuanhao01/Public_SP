# DAVI (Data Visualisation)

This was a module I took in Year 1 Semester 2 (Y1S2).

Here there is an additional folder `davi_sharing` which I placed here during my curriculum to share some of my code.  

As for the module, there were 2 assignments, `CA1` and 1`CA2`.  
As for `CA1` we had to submit 2 projects, a Solo project and a Group project.  

As for the group project, my responsibilities were,  
- Picking the topic and dataset
- Data wrangling
- Generating the insights and graphs in `Pandas` first
- Then making them in Tableu
- Presentation slides and presentation itself
