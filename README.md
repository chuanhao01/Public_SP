# My Singapore Polytechnic(SP) assignments/projects

Hi again, this repo is too mainly host my school projects on Github puclicly.  
I usually only upload my projects here after the semester ends, so I guess just look out for semesterly updates.  

If you are reading this and from SP, welcome to my repo, feel free to use my projects as references. (Don't copy them please :D)  

The modules are listed with their acronym first then their subject code beside them.  

Example:  
`FOC_ST2413` &rarr; `FOC` is for `Fundementals of Computing`, `ST2413` is the subject code.  

To find out more about the projects/assignemts for the module you can look into the folders, they would have a structure of,  
```bash
module folder
├── CAx
│   └── project/assignment folder
└── README.md
```
