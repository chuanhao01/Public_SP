# My Singapore Polytechnic(SP) assignments/projects

Hi, if you are reading this and from SP, welcome to my repo, feel free to use my projects as references. (Don't copy them please :D)  

The modules are listed with their acronym first then their subject code beside them.  

Example:  
`FOC_ST2413` &rarr; `FOC` is for `Fundementals of Computing`, `ST2413` is the subject code.  

To find out more about the projects/assignemts for the module you can look into the folders, they would have a structure of,  
```bash
module folder
├── CAx
│   ├── assignment folder
│   └── project/assignment folder
└── README.md
```
