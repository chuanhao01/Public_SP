# FED (Front-End Development) ST0501

This was a module I took in Year 1 Semester 1 (Y1S1).  

For this module, I had one project which spaned both terms, CA1 and CA2.  
As such there is only the final version of the project in the CA2 folder.  
You can find the entry point to the project at `CA2/project/HTML/index.html`.
