# FOP (Fundamentals of Programming) ST0502

This was a module I took in Year 1 Semester 1(Y1S1).

As for this module, we had a `CA1` and `CA2` assignment.  
I will try to look for the assignment specs but I am not sure where they are.  
I will also probably not explain much as to how to run the code as I do not really remember what I did.(This was done before I learnt and did documentation)
