The population of a country increased by an average of 2% per year from 2000 to 2003. If the population of this country was 2 000 000 on December 31, 2003, then the population of this country on January 1, 2000, to the nearest thousand would have been 
1 846 000 
1 852 000

f is a quadratic function whose graph is a parabola opening upward and has a vertex on the x-axis. The graph of the new function g defined by g(x) = 2 - f(x - 5) has a range defined by the interval 
[ -5 , + infinity) 
[ 2 , + infinity) 
( - infinity , 2] 
( - infinity , 0]

f is a function such that f(x) < 0. The graph of the new function g defined by g(x) = | f(x) | is a reflection of the graph of f 
on the y axis 
on the x axis 
on the line y = x 
on the line y = - x

If the graph of y = f(x) is transformed into the graph of 2y - 6 = - 4 f(x - 3), point (a , b) on the graph of y = f(x) becomes point (A , B) on the graph of 2y - 6 = - 4 f(x - 3) where A and B are given by 
A = a - 3, B = b 
A = a - 3, B = b 
A = a + 3, B = -2 b 
A = a + 3, B = -2 b +3

When a parabola represented by the equation y - 2x 2 = 8 x + 5 is translated 3 units to the left and 2 units up, the new parabola has its vertex at
