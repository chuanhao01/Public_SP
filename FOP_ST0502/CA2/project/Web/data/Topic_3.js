Evaporation takes place within the liquid
Temperature may change during evaporation
No bubbles are formed in the liquid during evaporation
2

Rate of evaporation is
directly proportional to the temperature of the liquid
inversely proportional to the temperature of the liquid
independent of the temperature of the liquid
directly proportional to the humidity of the surrounding air
